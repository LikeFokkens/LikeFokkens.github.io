I have been working as a post-doc in the [Molecular Plant Pathology lab](http://sils.uva.nl/content/research-groups/molecular-plant-pathology/molecular-plant-pathology) since 2013, where I studied genome organisation in _Fusarium oxysporum_ and performed various bioinformatic analyses for members in the group. I recently got a [NWO-Veni grant](https://www.nwo.nl/actueel/nieuws/2017/154-pas-gepromoveerde-onderzoekers-ontvangen-veni-van-250.000-euro.html) to set up my own line of research. 

_Fusarium oxysporum_ is well-known and well-studied as a plant pathogen - you'd almost forget most isolates are harmless or even function as a biocontrol. Horizontal transfer of a chromosome enriched in genes involved in infection of a pathogenic isolate can cause a previously harmless isolate to become pathogenic.
